## Featured Projects

### 1. Password Strength & Hashing Tool
Checks user passwords against multiple strength criteria (length, digits, symbols, repeats) and hashes them using `SHA-256` for secure storage.  
**Purpose:** Demonstrates secure password handling and regex-based validation.  
**Key Concepts:** Regex validation, hashing algorithms, input sanitation.  
**Tools:** Python, re, hashlib 

### 2. Port Scanner (Python)
A lightweight TCP port scanner that tests open ports across a specified range using Python’s `socket` library.  
**Purpose:** Detect active services, test firewall rules, and simulate reconnaissance behavior in ethical hacking labs.  
**Key Concepts:** TCP connections, socket timeouts, iteration over port ranges.  
**Tools:** Python, Socket  

### 3. SSH Intrusion Detector (macOS/Linux)
Script parses system authentication logs (`/var/log/auth.log` or `system.log`) to identify failed SSH login attempts and suspicious access patterns.  
**Purpose:** Automate log analysis and detect brute-force or unauthorized access attempts.  
**Key Concepts:** Regex, syslog parsing, failed password events, process automation.  
**Tools:** Python, Regular Expressions, macOS/Linux terminal

## Future Projects (In Development)

- **Email Log Intrusion Detector:** Expansion of the SSH detection tool to monitor suspicious email login patterns.  
- **Python Debugger for Security Scripts:** A modular debugging utility to trace vulnerabilities and code logic.  
- **Automated Nmap Wrapper:** Integrate Nmap scanning with Python for customized reporting and visualization.  

---

## Results & Learning Impact

- Developed a working understanding of **network reconnaissance, authentication events, and packet structure**.  
- Practiced **real-world analysis** of attack indicators in isolated virtualized environments.  
- Strengthened **Python automation, regex logic, and file I/O** skills for scalable log parsing and monitoring tasks.  
- Built a personal lab environment leveraging **Azure VMs** and **local macOS terminal utilities**.
